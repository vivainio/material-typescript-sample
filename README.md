# Material design (web) example for Typescript

I took the example at https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-web/ and changed the build environment to use typescript.

Also upgraded to webpack 4 (the example code was using webpack 3)

Caveat: there are no typings for material part, so they will appear as any.
